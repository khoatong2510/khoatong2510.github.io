Project Management Notes
=====

### Scrum 

### DSDM 

```[1] Key Project Problems```

1. Ineffective communication
    - DSDM provides guidance to strengthen communication
    - Encourage Visual and Verbal
    - Emphasis on Human interaction
    - Clearly define roles

2. Late Delivery
    - Delivering on time to short-term goals
    - Revising the scope

3. The deliveried solution does not meet the business needs
    - Business representatives are included as part of the Solution Dev Team
    - Embrace change

4. Building the right thing - the business changing their mind
    - Capitalises on the greater depth of understanding
    - Iterative Development
    - Regular Reviews

5. Unused features
    - Prioritise business needs
    - Focus on what is important

6. Delayed or late return on investment
    - Incremental delivery to get the most important and valuable features released
    - Deliver a subset of the total solution to enable early ROI

7. Over-engineering
    - Focus on the real business need, avoid being tempted
    - Prioritisation

8. "Fragile" Agile
    - Placing the right Agile concept
    - Construct in a structured and controlled framework

9. Waterfall dressed up as Agile
    - Just enought work up front to ensure objectives clarity
    - Active engagement of business roles in detail development

```[2] Leader's Framework for Decision Making```

1. Simple (known knowns) 
    - sense
    - categorize
    - respond

2. Complicated (knowns - unknowns)
    - sense
    - analyze
    - respond

3. Complex (unknowns - unknowns)
    - probs
    - sense
    - respond

4. Chaotic
    - act
    - sense
    - respond

```[3] Project Variables```

Traditional Waterfall:
    + Fixed: Features
    + Varied: Time, Cost, Quality

DSDM: 
    + Fixed: Time, Cost, Quality
    + Vary: Features

```[4] DSDM Principles```

1. Focus on the Business Need
2. Deliver on Time
3. Collaborate
4. Never Compromise Quality
5. Build Incrementally from Firm Foundations
6. Develop Iteratively
7. Communicate Continuosly and Clearly
8. Demonstrate Control

```[5] Roles and Responsiblities```

[5.1] Roles

1. Project-level roles:
    - Authority to direct the project
    - Responsible for the governance of the project
    - Liasing with governance authorities outside of the project

<br>

2. Solution Development Team Roles:
    - Shape and build the solution
    - Day-to-day development
    - Members are stable

<br>

3. Supporting roles
    - provide assistance and guidance to the project
    - not the empowered decision-makers
