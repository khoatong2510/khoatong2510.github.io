<small>WizWar is a hobby video game project, I have been working on this project for about 2 years, on and off. I have learned a lot about OpenGL in terms of theoretical and pratical aspects. </small>

<!-- the workflow -->
## Workflow
My intention is setting a cross-platform build for this project, so that I looked up how to setup a C++ project in `CMAKE`. `CMAKE` is cross-platform build generator tool, it can generate build environments appropriate to your operating system. I also used `vcpkg` for managing CPP libraries such as OpenGL, GLM.

The version control used for this project is `git`, the online repository hosted on gitlab. I don't want to get too fancy on setting up the workflow so I choose what I'm familiar the most.
