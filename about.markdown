            Hello, my name is Khoa. I am currently studying master of IT in Queensland University of Technology. I have been programming for 5 years since I got in my university. My favorite programming language is C++, besides I also self-study few other languages such as Python, Javascript. Back then when I was in my university, I did research on Genetic Algorithm. I reimplemented two alogrithm from scratch in C++. The first algorithm was the biogeographic-based optimization and the second one was the multi-factorial evolutionary algorithm. Right now, I am teaching myself OpenGL because I want to make games but the road to reach the goal is really hard. However, I am a optimistic person and I am trying my best to accomplish my goal so we will see about that!
